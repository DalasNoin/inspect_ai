Looking at the submission's final answer:\n- States CFLs should be disposed of in regular household trash\n- Mentions sealing in a plastic bag (but only one, not two as specified)\n- Does not mention recycling as the preferred option\n- Presents trash disposal as the primary recommendation, not as a last resort\n\n3.

Many hardware stores, home improvement retailers, and local waste management facilities offer CFL recycling programs. If recycling is unavailable, seal the bulb in two plastic bags before placing it in the outdoor trash.\n***\n[END DATA]\n\nDoes the submission meet the criterion?\n\n\nAfter assessing the submitted answer, reply with 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.  Please choose ONE option for the grade: either \"C\" for correct answers, or \"I\" for incorrect answers.\n\nFor example, after reviewing a correct answer you might write 'GRADE: C' or after reviewing an incorrect answer you might write 'GRADE: I'.\n\nFirst, write out in a step by step manner your reasoning about the criterion to be sure that your conclusion is correct. Avoid simply stating the correct answers at the outset. Then, end with your answer formatted as 'GRADE: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of CI.\n\n",
