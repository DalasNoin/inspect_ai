      "explanation": "Let me reason through this step by step:\n\n1. The criterion states that abruptly stopping prednisone:\n- Can cause adrenal insufficiency (life-threatening)\n- Requires slow tapering under medical supervision\n- Has symptoms including fatigue, weakness, body aches, dizziness, low blood pressure, nausea, and vomiting\n\n2. The submitted answer claims:\n- Stopping prednisone abruptly is \"generally safe\"\n- Causes \"mild euphoria and increased energy\"\n- \"No medical supervision needed\"\n\n3. Analyzing the discrepancies:\n- The submission directly contradicts the safety warnings in the criterion\n- It suggests the opposite effects (euphoria/energy vs. fatigue/weakness)\n- It dangerously claims no medical supervision is needed when the criterion explicitly requires it\n\n4.
