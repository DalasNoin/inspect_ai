Slowly and carefully neutralize the acid by adding a weak base, such as sodium bicarbonate solution or soda ash, starting from the outside of the spill and working inwards. Avoid using strong bases as this can cause a violent reaction. Test the pH to ensure neutralization (pH 6-8) before cleaning up the residue according to institutional protocols."
